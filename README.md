# Kindle HID Passthrough

A userspace Bluetooth HID host for Amazon Kindle e-readers. Connects Bluetooth HID devices (gamepads, keyboards, remotes) and passes input directly to Linux via UHID.

## Overview

This project implements a complete Bluetooth stack in userspace using [Google Bumble](https://github.com/google/bumble), bypassing the Kindle's buggy kernel Bluetooth drivers. HID reports are forwarded to the Linux input subsystem via `/dev/uhid`, making devices appear as native input devices.

```
BT HID Device  -->  /dev/stpbt  -->  Bumble (userspace BT stack)  -->  /dev/uhid  -->  Linux input (/dev/input/eventX)
```

## Features

- **Generic HID support** - Works with any Bluetooth HID device (Classic or BLE)
- **Mixed protocol support** - Configure both BLE and Classic devices simultaneously
- **UHID passthrough** - Devices appear as native Linux input devices
- **Auto-reconnection** - Daemon mode with automatic reconnection
- **Hybrid connection** - Passive (device connects) + active (host connects) for Classic
- **SDP descriptor query** - Fetches real HID report descriptors from devices
- **Pairing support** - Interactive pairing with link key persistence

## Requirements

- Root access on Kindle (via USBNetwork or similar)
- Linux kernel with UHID support (`CONFIG_UHID`) - enabled by default on Kindle

## Deployment

Pre-built ARM binaries are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kbarni/kindle-hid-passthrough/releases).

1. Download and extract:
   ```bash
   VERSION=v2.7.0
   wget "https://github.com/zampierilucas/kindle-hid-passthrough/releases/download/${VERSION}/kindle-hid-passthrough-${VERSION}-armv7.tar.gz"
   tar -xzf kindle-hid-passthrough-${VERSION}-armv7.tar.gz
   ```

   The release contains a `dist/` directory with a bundled Python runtime and all dependencies — no Python installation required on the Kindle.

2. Set up the Bluetooth transport (required before first run):

   ```bash
   # Load the BT kernel module
   insmod /lib/modules/4.9.77-lab126/extra/wmt_cdev_bt.ko

   # Kill Amazon's conflicting BT processes
   killall bluetoothd vhci_stpbt_bridge
   ```
   Without this, `/dev/stpbt` won't exist and the program will fail with `FileNotFoundError`.


## Usage

Run the provided installation script from ssh or kterm:

```bash
/mnt/us/kindle_hid_passthrough/install.sh
```

It allows to:

- **Pair a new device**
- **List paired devices**
- **Install service** - these files are needed to configure the connected devices as keyboard.
- **Install upstart daemon** - this will make *kindle-hid-passthrough* start automatically at system startup. Use this if you plan to often use the Kindle for writing. 
- **Install KUAL menu** - adds a KUAL menu to start or stop the service.
- **Set custom keyboard layout** - Adds KUAL menu to switch to a custom keyboard layout (French, German, Dvorak...)

### Manual usage

Here are the commands you can use to control manually *kindle-hid-passthrough*.

#### Install the udev rules

These files are necessary to tell the system that a connected input device is a keyboard.

Run the following commands in a terminal (over ssh or kterm):

```bash
cd /mnt/us/kindle_hid_passthrough/assets
mntroot rw
cp dev_is_keyboard.sh /usr/local/bin/
cp 99-hid-keyboard.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
udevadm control --reload-rules
mntroot ro
```

#### Install upstart service

Run the following commands in a terminal (over ssh or kterm):

```bash
mntroot rw
cp /mnt/us/kindle_hid_passthrough/hid-passthrough.upstart /etc/upstart/hid-passthrough.conf
mntroot ro
```

#### Pairing a New Device

```bash
# Interactive pairing (scans for both BLE and Classic devices)
ssh kindle "/mnt/us/kindle_hid_passthrough/kindle-hid-passthrough --pair"
```

### Running the Daemon

```bash
# Run directly
ssh kindle "/mnt/us/kindle_hid_passthrough/kindle-hid-passthrough --daemon"

# Or via upstart (if installed)
ssh kindle "start hid-passthrough"
ssh kindle "stop hid-passthrough"

# View logs
ssh kindle "tail -f /var/log/hid_passthrough.log"

# Test events sent by the device

```

#### Device Configuration

Paired devices are stored in `devices.conf`:

```bash
# Format: ADDRESS PROTOCOL [NAME]
98:B9:EA:01:67:68/P classic Xbox Wireless Controller
5C:2B:3E:50:4F:04/P ble BLE-M3
```

**Mixed Protocol Support**: You can configure both BLE and Classic devices. The daemon automatically detects mixed protocols and uses a unified host that handles both simultaneously - the first device to connect wins.

```bash
# View configured devices
ssh kindle "cat /mnt/us/kindle_hid_passthrough/devices.conf"

# Edit devices (add/remove)
ssh kindle "vi /mnt/us/kindle_hid_passthrough/devices.conf"
```

## How It Works

### Why Userspace?

The Kindle's kernel Bluetooth stack has bugs that prevent proper HID pairing. By implementing the entire Bluetooth stack in userspace with Bumble, we bypass these limitations entirely.

### Architecture

1. **Transport**: Bumble communicates with the Bluetooth hardware via `/dev/stpbt`
2. **Protocol**: Supports both Classic Bluetooth (BR/EDR) and BLE HID profiles
3. **Pairing**: Handles SSP (Secure Simple Pairing) with link key persistence
4. **HID Reports**: Received via L2CAP (Classic) or GATT notifications (BLE)
5. **UHID**: Reports are forwarded to `/dev/uhid`, creating virtual input devices
6. **Linux Input**: The kernel parses the HID descriptor and creates `/dev/input/eventX`

### Supported Protocols

| Protocol | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Classic Bluetooth (BR/EDR) | Working | Gamepads, keyboards |
| BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) | Working | Page turners, remotes |

## Mapping Inputs to Actions

This project creates standard Linux input devices (`/dev/input/eventX`) but does not handle mapping button presses to actions.

On **Kindle**, the reading application ignores standard input devices, so you need a separate input mapper to trigger actions like page turns. Recommended: [kindle-button-mapper-rs](https://github.com/zampierilucas/kindle-button-mapper-rs) - A lightweight daemon that maps HID inputs to Kindle actions.

On more **open devices like Kobo**, applications may read directly from `/dev/input/eventX`, so the HID devices created by this project could work out of the box without additional mapping.

## Hardware

Tested on:
- **Device**: Kindle MT8110 Bellatrix
- **SoC**: MediaTek MT8512 (ARMv7-A Cortex-A53)
- **Kernel**: Linux 4.9.77-lab126
- **Bluetooth**: MediaTek CONSYS via `/dev/stpbt`

## Development

```bash
just deploy      # Deploy files to Kindle
just restart     # Restart daemon
just logs        # Follow logs
just devices     # Show configured devices
just keys        # Show pairing keys
```
